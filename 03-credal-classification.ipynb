    "## Exact Probability Bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``naive_credal_prob`` function in the code above\n",
    "uses the approximate bounds for $\\underline{p}(c,a)$ and $\\overline{p}(c,a)$ that we saw in the lectures:\n",
    "$$\\underline{p}(c,a)=\\inf_{t}\\frac{n(c)+s t(c)}{N+s}\\prod_{i=1}^k\\frac{n(a_i,c)+s t(a_i,c)}{n(c) + s t(c)}\\ge\\frac{n(c)}{N+s}\\prod_{i=1}^k\\frac{n(a_i,c)}{n(c) + s}$$\n",

When doing so, pay particular attention to the number of attributes. For instance, investigate the impact when predicting severity just from BI-RADS, as opposed to predicting severity from all available attributes."

    "   Try and implement a robust Bayes maximal version of the credal classifier using Zaffalon's formula for dominance.\n",
    "   Hint:\n",
    "   Unfortunately, the formula you derived in the previous part is not necessarily monotone.\n",
    "   However, as a rough approximation, you may for instance discretize the problem\n",

    "   You can also make use of the ``is_maximal`` function\n",
    "   once you realize that this code can also work with objects other than vectors of real numbers\n",
    "   (such as, say, classes).\n",

    "4. Test and compare your new classifier with the interval maximality one.\n",
    "   Try predicting severity, but also try predicting BI-RADS (as in one of the previous tasks).\n",
    "   How has the new classifier improved?\n",

    "   theoretically coincides with the robust Bayes admissible credal classifier (which we will not implement).\n",
    "   However, when predicting BI-RADS, this is no longer the case.\n",
    "   Explain why.\n",
    "\n",

    "some code to get started is provided below for your convenience."
